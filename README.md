## General Information
- problem statement: customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate.
- retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal
- problem statement: customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate.To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn
- our goal is to build a machine learning model that is able to predict churning customers based on the features provided for their usage.
- In churn prediction, we assume that there are three phases of customer lifecycle :

The ‘good’ phase: In this phase, the customer is happy with the service and behaves as usual.
The ‘action’ phase: The customer experience starts to sore in this phase
The ‘churn’ phase: In this phase, the customer is said to have churned.
